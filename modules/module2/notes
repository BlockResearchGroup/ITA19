update compas using SourceTree
switch to new-plotters branch
activate ita19-dev environment
check if new plotters available
update environment with nb_conda
get Week 3 files

overview: notebook > VS Code > Rhino

plotters
    old vs new
        new plotters aligned with
        new plotters built for Primitives, Shapes, Data Structures
    plot primitives
        plot point
        plot line
        plot vector
        change visual style
    animated plots
        apply transformations
        step-wise visualisation

Part 1: Geometry

impossible to give comprehensive overview of "world of geometry".
or even of the geometry (processing) algorithms available in COMPAS.
instead have a closer look at some of the fundamental tools that are at the hart of most of these algorithms.
two examples (ranging from the very simple to the very sophisticated): cross product & SVD

cross product
    what is cross product
    computation of cross product
    compare python based and numpy based calculation of multiple cross products
    CCW rotation vs CW rotation
    link to is_ccw
    where else is cross product used
    link to transformations (Rhino)

SVD
    what is SVD
    where is SVD used
    information obtained from SVD
    SVD in compas
    make pointcloud in Rhino
    compute principle components of pointcloud covariance matrix to find local frame
    compute bounding box using local frame

Part 2: Data Structures

compas data structures overview
how to use data structures
get information out of data structures (questions)
vertex normals
smoothing
subdivision
mesh dual
tributary areas
(notice cross product)

assignments

outlook to modules
