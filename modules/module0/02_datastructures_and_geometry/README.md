# Assignment

1. Given two vectors, use the cross product to create a set of three ortho**normal** vectors.
2. Use the cross product to compute the area of a convex, 2D polygon.
3. Define a function for computing the cross products of two arrays of vectors.
  a. The input arrays have the same length (same number of vectors).
  b. Prototype in pure Python (loop over the arrays).
  c. Make Numpy equivalent without loops.
