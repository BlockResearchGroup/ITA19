# ITA PhD course

*Computational research with COMPAS*

## Description

The PhD-level course (primarily for A&T PhDs) will introduce computational methods for architecture engineering, fabrication & construction, incentivising computational literacy. Students learn the theoretical background and basic implementation details of fundamental data structures and algorithms, and to solve real-world problems using the COMPAS framework and other open-source libraries.

## Learning objectives

* understand the scope and relevance of computational methods for architecture and engineering research and practice,
* the theoretical background of fundamental data structures, 
* the basic principles of algorithmic design; 
* implement basic versions of prevalent algorithms related to architectural geometry, structural design, robotic assembly, volumetric modeling & 3D-printing, high-performance computation; 
* use sophisticated algorithms available through open-source libraries to solve real-world problems; and, 
* use common CAD tools as interfaces to self-implemented solutions.

## Overview

Course will consist of a few lectures, several tutorials and project-based exercises.

Topics will include:

* Intro Python programming
* Intro COMPAS open-source framework (https://compas-dev.github.io/) 
* Intro to geometry processing, data structures, topology, numerical computation
* Domain-specific case studies (e.g. on architectural geometry, structural design, robotic assembly, volumetric modeling and 3D printing, high performance computation)
